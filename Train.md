Train^[[[Tale 5 - All Aboard!]]] is an anthropomorphic train that serves Twistwood. They run the Twistwood Express service and delivers many passengers into the wood early in the Tales.

# Physical Appearance
It is unclear whether Train consists solely of the locomotive or includes the carriages that form the Twistwood Express.

Train's locomotive is a brown steam engine with a face on the front. They have a lantern, whistle, and a cab for a driver to sit in.

Train's carriages are also brown and include black curtains. The foremost carriage in [[Tale 5 - All Aboard!]] has "Express" written on it to denote the nature of the service. Inside the carriages are forward facing seats and a central aisle.

# Characteristics
Train is a 'Self "Esteem" Engine and is fuelled by belief in themself. When they lack self-belief, their fuel runs low and they begin to slow. However, encouragement from others can make them overconfident, as seen when they think they can pull off a 360 flip when full of passengers^[[[Tale 5 - All Aboard!]]].

# References
Train is a reference to [The Little Engine That Could](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Engine_That_Could) which is a folk tale which teaches children the value of optimism and hard work.
