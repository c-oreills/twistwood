# Synopsis
[[Bailey]] and [[Padlock]] are in swimming gear, running down the beach towards the sea, where [[Loghead]] is already splashing. [[Bucket Boy]] asks [[Rock Girl]] if she's coming along, but she tells him that she'd sink and encourages him to go on without her.

Rock Girl sits alone on the beach with her spade and sadly watches the others having fun. Bucketboy turns back, spots her spade, and the two have fun together building a sandcastle on the beach.

# Interpretation
It's been commented by the author that by using his head to make a sandcastle, Bucket Boy has gone ["head over heels"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/head_over_heels) for Rock Girl (or more correctly, heels over head, as per the original phrasing)^[Instagram comment from @bytwistwood "he's head over heels ;)"]. This suggests he may be in love with her.
