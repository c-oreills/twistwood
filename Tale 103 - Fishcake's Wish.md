> Fishcake’s Wish! The King of Seals and Fishcake return. Also long term readers, you may recognise the man on the rock. If I met the King of Seals I would wish for one of those sea shells that sound like the ocean when you hold em up to your ear. So that i can put it next to my pillow and save my phone’s battery life from playing those “10hr sounds of waves” YouTube videos overnight to help sleep
