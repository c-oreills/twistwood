Loghead has chronic insomnia as a result of staying up late, which he is sensitive about, masking his condition with jokes^[[[Tale 1]]]. Though he is outwardly happy, his insomnia can cause him to threaten violence^[citation needed] or distort his vision^[citation needed].

Loghead repeatedly seeks treatment for his insomnia^[citation needed], thus far unsuccessfully.
