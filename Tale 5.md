# Synopsis
[[Train]] is rolling through the woods with carriages in tow when the [[Minor Characters#Train Crew and Passengers|driver rabbit]] asks why they're slowing down. Train responds that they're running out of fuel. 

The [[Minor Characters#Train Crew and Passengers|guard dog]] announces to the [[Minor Characters#Train Crew and Passengers|passengers]] that Train runs on self-esteem and encourages them to cheer Train on. They do so and Train's self-belief is restored, but Train becomes overconfident and believes they're capable of a 360 flip off some ramped track over a cliff, just after a fork.

# Interpretation
The immediate aftermath of this is unknown, but given that Train and the passengers are seen later^[citation needed] it seems that either the flip was successful or Train decided against it at the last moment.
