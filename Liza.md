Liza lives together with [[Henry]] in a house next to a stream.

# Physical Appearance
Liza has brown hair. She wears a brown dress with a white pinny over it, and a brown hat.

# Characteristics
Both Liza and Henry are outwardly cheerful but callous. They show no regards for the wellbeing of others, for example throwing what is presumably their own [[Bathtub Baby Bear|Baby]] out of a window and into a stream. ^[[[Tale 3 - A Near Disaster!]]]

# References
Henry and Liza reference the characters in the nursery rhyme [There's a Hole in My Bucket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_a_Hole_in_My_Bucket). This is echoed when they meet [[Bucket Boy]] and believe him to be useless due to his leaky eyeholes^[citation needed].
