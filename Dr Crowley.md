Dr Crowley is the resident doctor of Twistwood and uses questionable methods to heal those within it. He is the most featured character in Twistwood Tales, having appeared in the more strips than any other character (as of [[Tale 120 - Wrist Trouble]]).

# Physical Appearance
Dr Crowley is an anthropomorphic crow who resembles a [plague doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor). His appearance is mostly silhoutted, so few details can be discerned from his physical form.

He has a long curved beak which is similar to a plague doctor's mask. He wears a hat with a brown hatband and glasses with brown rims. He also appears to have a high-collared trenchcoat, sturdy gloves and boots. Occasionally his eye socket or collar can be seen highlighted.
