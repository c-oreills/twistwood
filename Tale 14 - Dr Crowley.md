# Synopsis
[[Dr Crowley]] is finishing stitching up the [[The Wise Giant]]^[[Instagram comment](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4GIhatDnti/) by @mx_margret: "Is he stitching up the giant who had the wolves inside of him? Did he remove them?"; response by @bytwistwood: "that's right! ^_^"] when [[Wendy]] and [[Mendy]] call him. They are carrying [[Grim]] on a stretcher, having found him under a bridge with a broken leg.

Dr Crowley reacts excitedly that he'll be amputating Grim's leg, but Grim protests, questioning what kind of medical school Crowley attended. Crowley is confused, questioning what a medical school is and implying that he hasn't been.

# Interpretation
The Wise Giant appearance here means he apparently sought out medical attention for eating two live wolves.^[[[Tale 2 - The Wise Giant]]] He later appears again being treated for the same thing.^[[[Tale 93 - Wendy and Soo]]]

Grim has broken his leg under a bridge due to [[Bailey]] throwing him off.^[[[Tale 7 - The Bully]]] He later appears with a peg leg^[[[]]]
