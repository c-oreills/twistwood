The Wise Giant is a giant who dwells in Twistwood.

# Physical Appearance
The Wise Giant is much larger than the other characters. He wears a dark waistcoat, pale green shirt, shabby blue trousers and dark boots. His trousers have been repaired several times with patches made from whole garments. He is balding, having lost all the hair from the top of his head.

# Characteristics
Though his name suggests wisdom, this is questionable given his inaction in seeking urgent medical attention when needed^[[[Tale 2]]]. His diet includes swallowing animals live, which causes him digestive issues^[[[Tale 2]]].
