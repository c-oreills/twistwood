Bathtub Baby (canonical name unknown) is a small baby, presumably [[Henry and Liza]]'s.

Bathtub Baby gets thrown into a stream^[[[Tale 3]]] and presumably transforms into Murderbear^[[[Tale 6]]]. Their current wherabouts is unknown.

# Physical Appearance
Bathtub Baby is a small naked baby, with small strands of hair atop their head.

# Characteristics
Despite being tossed into a stream, Bathtub Baby retains a cheerful expression throughout their ordeal.

Given that they make their way downstream to the Enchanted Pond unharmed, it seems that Bathtub Baby can swim, or at least float.
