# Synopsis
A Murderbear is chasing a woman and a man, who scream a warning to run. The Murderbear falls into the Enchanted Pond.

The Pond has the power to transform whatever dips into it into the previous thing which dipped into it. The Murderbear transforms into a pigeon and is confused.

As the pigeon flies away, the woman and man walk off in relief, saying "All's well that ends well". However, the [[Bathtub Baby Bear|Bathtub Baby]] crests a waterfall which flows into the Enchanted Pond. It's implied that they will transform into the Murderbear when they fall in the pond.

# Interpretation
Commenters have questioned how the Enchanted Pond came to be and what happened to the first thing that dipped into it.

They also wonder if the being next being who is dipped and gets transformed into a baby will age and grow up into an adult, effectively rendering the Enchanted Pond a fountain of youth (albeit youth as a different person).
