This page documents minor characters within Twistwood Tales. The Tales have a large and diverse cast of named and unnamed characters.

The line around what constitutes "minor" is blurry but generally if a character doesn't drive the narrative in two or more strips then they can be considered minor. If a minor character gets more story development, they should be promoted to a full [[:Category:Character|Character]] page.
