[[Lute Girl]] is playing music on her lute, which [[Rock Girl]] compliments her on. Lute Girl says she's playing to try to attract the attention of her crush, whose is sitting nearby in his house with the window open.

Sadly, he is already listening to The Beetles play, and Lute Girl feels she cannot compete with them.
