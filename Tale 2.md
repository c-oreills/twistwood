# Synopsis
Wandering the woods, [[Loghead]] and [[Padlock]] encounter the [[Wise Giant]] sitting on a well. They ask him for a parable and he tells them about two wolves fighting inside of him.

[[Padlock]] excitedly thinks he recognises the parable, but it turns out that the [[Wise Giant]] was speaking literally and is in need of medical attention.

# Interpretation
Commenters point out that, given the Wise Giant's inaction in seeking urgent medical attention, he's probably not so wise after all.
