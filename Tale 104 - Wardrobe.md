# Caption
> “Wardrobe” Charlie, who first appeared in  # 57, returns! This is inspired by a similar experience when I was younger, afraid of creatures in the attic (I had a door in my bedroom that led to the attic, where I was told there was a ghost of the house's architect, but in the form of a peacock. He would dance on the roof beams at night.)
