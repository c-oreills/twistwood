# Synopsis
[[Loghead]] and [[Padlock]] watch geese flying south overhead. Loghead remarks that it's migraine season.

Padlock laughs and corrects him that it's "migration" season. A woodpecker lands on Loghead's head. As the woodpecker hammers on his skull, Loghead asserts that his original phrasing was correct. Padlock looks on in horror.

# Interpretation
According to the author's Instagram comments, the woodpecker's style is an homage to [Drinky Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drinky_Crow_Show)
