# Synopsis
[[Rose]] is playing music on her lute, which [[Rock Girl]] compliments her on. Lute Lady says she's playing to try to attract the attention of her crush, whose is sitting nearby in his house with the window open.

Sadly, he is already listening to The Beetles play, and Lute Lady feels she cannot compete with them.

# Interpretation
The punchline of this comic is a pun on [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles).

The author has confirmed in Instagram comments that the hidden bear is the [[Bathtub Baby Bear]] transformed by the Enchanted Pond^[Instagram comment by @meliponin_a "The bear it's the baby?"; response by @bytwistwood: "bingo"], and also appears later with Sleepy the Squirrel^[Instagram comment by @kiddwukong: "I bet that's the same [bear] that goes on to find the squirrel"; response by @bytwistwood: "it is ^_^"].
