# Synopsis
[[Bucket Boy]] is running from [[Grim]], who is pelting him with rocks, cracking Bucket Boy's goggles. He runs to [[Bailey]], who is sitting on a bridge, and asks for help.

Bailey suggests that the best way of dealing with a bully like Grim is ignoring or befriending them.

Grim switches to insulting Bailey and Bailey promptly tosses Grim from the bridge and into a chasm.
