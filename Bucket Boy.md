Bucket Boy is a small boy with a bucket for a head.

# Physical Appearance
Bucket Boy has a grey metal bucket for a head. His eyeholes leak water unless they're covered by his goggles. His skin is the same grey metal as his head^[[[Tale 10 - Rock Girl]]].

He wears a yellow raincoat with matching trousers and orange Wellington boots.

# Characteristics
Bucket Boy lacks self confidence and sometimes thinks that he is worthless, especially when his leaky eyes stop him from carrying water^[citation needed].

Bucket Boy is sensitive to others' emotions, keeping Rock Girl company when she is lonely rather than playing with his friends^[[[Tale 10 - Rock Girl]]].
