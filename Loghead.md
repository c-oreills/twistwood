Loghead is a person with a log for a head. He is one of the main characters of Twistwood Tales and is the avatar for the series.

# Physical Appearance
Loghead is a humanoid with a Twistwood log for a head. He wears a pale green jacket, shirt, bow tie and boots, and brown stripey trousers.

# Characteristics
Loghead has chronic insomnia as a result of staying up late, which he is sensitive about, masking his condition with jokes^[[[Tale 1]]]. Though he is outwardly happy, his insomnia can cause him to threaten violence^[citation needed] or distort his vision^[citation needed].

Loghead repeatedly seeks treatment for his insomnia^[citation needed], thus far unsuccessfully.

Loghead suffers from seasonal migraines, caused by woodpeckers hammering on his skull^[[[Tale 11]]]. He bears this suffering stoicly with a smile on his face. It's been suggested that he may have insects in his head, since woodpeckers drill into dead wood to find live food, but these suggestions have not been endorsed by the author^[Instagram comments on [[Tale 11]]].
