# Synopsis


# Caption
> Once when i was younger i was staying in a converted monastery. At night i found it very hard to sleep as my neighbours were always playing the radio loud on the classical channel. Classic music like monks singing. I thought it was quite rude and inconsiderate. It was only once i finally left that i was told there were no neighbours. Haha Have you a ghost story experience?
