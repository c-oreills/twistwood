> Candibal returns and has a question for Dr Crowley. Recently i’ve been trying a new “diet” of sorts where i try and cut out as much sugar as possible but it’s tricky. I find myself saying “well, peanut butter is allowed, and i can have that on a rice cracker - surely- that won’t be problem.” I then proceed to eat six of them one after another. -___- hey ho. Its progress of a sort!
