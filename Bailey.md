Bailey is a human or humanoid whose head looks like a haystack.

# Physical Appearance
Bailey's head looks like a haystack. It's unclear whether this is hair or if he's a similar being to [[Loghead]] or [[Bucket Boy]]. His hands are purple but no other skin is visible.

He wears a red long sleeved shirt with a grid pattern and a black waistcoat with gold buttons. He has green trousers which have been mended with black patches. He has black boots.

# Characteristics
Bailey stands up for others and himself when mistreated. Often this involves resorting to physical acts of defiance, such as throwing bullies from bridges^[[[Tale 7]]] or luggage from cliffs^[citation needed]. He talks about solving problems non-violently but has never been seen to put this into practice.
