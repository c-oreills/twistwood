# Synopsis
A mighty warrior sits combing her long hair atop a huge mound of corpses, weapons and  armour. A small bird sings, perched on a shield beside her.

The bird retrieves his hat and briefcase from behind a chipped sword and flies home. His wife is doing housework and cheerfully enquires about his day. Shellshocked, he tells her about all the blood.
