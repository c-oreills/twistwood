Henry is a blonde haired man with a moustache. He wears a white shirt and brown trousers with braces.

Liza has brown hair. She wears a brown dress with a white pinny over it, and a brown hat.

# References
Henry and Liza reference the characters in the nursery rhyme [There's a Hole in My Bucket](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_a_Hole_in_My_Bucket). This is echoed when they meet [[Bucket Boy]] and believe him to be useless due to his leaky eyeholes^[citation needed].
