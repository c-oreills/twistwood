# Synopsis
[[Henry]] and [[Liza]] are at home. Henry is about to throw bathwater out of the window with a [[Bathtub Baby Bear|Baby]] in it, but Liza stops him, warning that he's about to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Henry is relieved at the averted disaster, but instead throws only the Baby out of the window and into a stream. He then takes a bath in the retained water.

# Interpretation
The tale subverts the idiom ["Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater) , meaning not to eliminate something good when trying to get rid of something bad.

Some sources^[[What does "Throwing the Baby out with the Bath Water" Mean?](https://www.languagehumanities.org/what-does-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bath-water-mean.htm)] attribute the idiom to the fact that private bathing was rare and arduous in Medieval Europe. This meant bathwater was more likely to be shared, with adults bathing first and then children in descending order of age. This meant that babies were likely to be bathed in very murky water, increasing the imagined risk that they'd be discarded along with the water.
