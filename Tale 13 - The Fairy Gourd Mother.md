# Synopsis
[[UN Pumpkinhead]] and [[Padlock]] are hidden behind a log, watching the eerie [[Minor Characters#Fairy Gourd Mother|Fairy Gourd Mother]]. Pumpkinhead explains how she gives all good pumpkins a candle on Hallowe'en.

As Padlock asks what happens to bad pumpkins the Fairy Gourd Mother takes off and her cloak blows open to reveal orange talons holding a cage with imprisoned decapitated^[[Instagram comment](https://www.instagram.com/p/B35Rm7vAszu/) by @s_u_b_z_3_r_o: "They could legit all hop out!"; response by @bytwistwood: "if they still had their bodies!"] pumpkins.

Padlock is shocked, but Pumpkinhead avoids his question^[[Instagram comment](https://www.instagram.com/p/B35Rm7vAszu/) by @monsir.arts: "i love how the pumpkin just totally avoided the question"; response by @bytwistwood: "@monsir.arts haha yes"] and shares his hopes for a vanilla scented candle.

# Interpretation
In Panel 1 a pumpkin can be seen under the Fairy Gourd Mother's cloak, foreshadowing the reveal in Panel 3.

Fairy Gourd Mother's name is a pun on "Fairy God Mother" and gourd, a family of vegetables which includes pumpkins, cucumbers, squashes and melons.

An example of something that may mark a pumpkin bad is *TODO:fixme* as demonstated in [[Tale 87]]^[[Instagram comment](https://www.instagram.com/p/B35Rm7vAszu/) by @deadly_darling_: "what makes a pumpkin bad?"; response by @bytwistwood: "Episode 87 gives a wee hint ^_^"]

[[UN Pumpkinhead]] is later seen with a vanilla scented candle in *TODO:fixme*.

This Tale is reposted at Hallowe'en to celebrate the holiday.
