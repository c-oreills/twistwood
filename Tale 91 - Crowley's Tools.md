# Caption
> “Crowley’s Tools” (10 points to Gryffindor if you can spot my Larson homage in this one! ) Are you a fan of going to the dentist? Recently I had to go to the dentist to get a filling - the term root canal was mentioned and although it didn’t come to that, the experience did give me inspiration for this wee Tale. Gill the Gamekeeper visits Dr Crowley.
