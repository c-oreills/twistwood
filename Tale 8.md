# Synopsis
Mausa runs through tall grass in the rain, holding her hat to her head in one hand and a bag in the other. As she crosses a stream with a twig bridge, the rain intensifies.

She runs down a path towards a tree with windows and a door at the base. Firelight is visible from inside.

Her family open the door for her to a dining room with a roaring fireplace. The table is set with a cheese dinner and her family have been waiting for her arrival to begin.
